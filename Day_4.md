> Date: March 22, 2023

It feels absolutely amazing to see folks participating in the #BIOS100DaysOfCode Challenge. I can see everyone trying to be better each day and pushing forward and it feels like a big victory already.

Love the [@BIOS_twt](https://twitter.com/bios_twt) community ‚ù§

So here is how my day 4 was:

- Learnt more about how Frontend and Backend integrate with each other
- Started learning basic Hooks of ReactJS
- Worked on a UX Design Project.

Will try to move on to NextJS as soon as I can, because it seems extremely exciting.
